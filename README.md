This portfolio project is a hands-on exercise. In the skills section,
the experience that exists is not entirely true, I would love it to be true hahaha, 
the projects carried out section as well.

This project is a course by Felipe Gav√≠lan [https://github.com/gavilanch],
here we practice concepts of ASP.NET MVC.
